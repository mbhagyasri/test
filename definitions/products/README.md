# Products

A product is a group of services and applications. A product can be used to group cost/resource management.

- One definition for each product
- One definition for each service or application that is linked to the product.

## Application types

- svc -> service -> a headless application
- app -> application -> a ui application
- bff -> backend-for-frontend -> a backend service that is directly coupled to a front end application.
- api -> api exposed through an api gateway. An abstraction used to expose an api that allows it to be decoupled from its implementing service.
